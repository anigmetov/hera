This repository contains software to compute bottleneck and Wasserstein
distances between persistence diagrams, and matching distance
between 2-parameter persistence modules and (1-critical) bi-filtrations.

The software is licensed under
BSD license, see license.txt file.
If you are going to use this software for research purposes,
you probably do not need to worry about that.

See README files in subdirectories for usage and building.

If you use Hera in your project, we would appreciate if you
cite the corresponding paper.
